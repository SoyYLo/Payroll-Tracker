## User Story

As a developer I want to create a webpage where employers can track their employees salary
So that they may organize employee info and properly budget for the company.

## Description 

On this webpage the employer will be provided a set of questions to gather employee information. 
The employer will enter the first name, last name and salary of any employee.
When the employer is finished entering the information the webpage will gather the information and display the employees on an organized table.
In the console log, it will display the average salary among the total employees that are entered. 
The console log will also choose an employee at random for the employer to view.

## Code Source

I was provided a starter code for the index.html, css, and javascript file. This starter code was provided in Gitlab under the Coding Bootcamp of UT at Austin UTA-VIRT-FSF-PT-03-2024-U-LOLC. I modified the starter html and css to make it unique to me. There was starter code in the script.js file I was not allowed to modify. I was then required to create a section of code myself to complete the functions of this project in the script.js file.
