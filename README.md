# Payroll-Tracker

## User Story

As a developer I want to create a webpage where employers can track their employees salary
So that they may organize employee info and properly budget for the company.

## Description 

On this webpage the employer will be provided a set of questions to gather employee information. 
The employer will enter the first name, last name and salary of any employee.
When the employer is finished entering the information the webpage will gather the information and display the employees on an organizaed table.
In the console log, it will display the average salary amoung the total employees that are entered. 
The console log will also choose an employee at random for the emmployer to view.
